# French 5000

Help improve **French 5000**, an Anki deck for English speakers learning French. The deck contains the 5,000 most frequent French words, with extensive example sentences, grammar notes, audio, and more.

This repository is the English-learning version of the original German-to-French deck. French source text is preserved; German learner-facing definitions, translations, grammar explanations, and interface text are translated into English.

## Grammar

The [grammar](grammar) directory contains the grammar-library entries. The directory hierarchy is also used to organize the grammar library.

A grammar entry can be embedded in a card note with `<grammar data-id="ID"></grammar>`. Some internal IDs and schema field names remain in German for compatibility with the original Anki note type; learner-facing text is English.
